## Tecnologies
- React.js
- Vite
- CSS
- Formspree
- Redux
- Axios
- Bootstrap
- Materialize
- UUID

## The Process
Vite was used to start the project and obtain a template. The Pufi folder is created, which will contain the following folders:

- components
- layout
- pages
  
At the Pufi folder level, the assets folder is found, which contains all the images used in the Home. Finally, the store folder will contain the logic for the form.

## What I learned 
During the development of the technical test, we learned how to use the Formspree library for the form.
- Formspree

## How can it be improved?
- Improve the styles and responsive
- Add more functionalities in buttons
